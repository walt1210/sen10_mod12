  <!-- Explanation of why it's ugly -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why this UI is terrible</h2>
    <p>
      The Craigslist Pampanga site has a very dense layout with too many links and minimal spacing, making it difficult to scan quickly.
      Typography and colors are basic and outdated, giving a dated feel. 
      The site lacks visual hierarchy and modern usability conventions, making navigation confusing and overwhelming.

    <h2>How I would improve it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce a clear color palette and consistent typography hierarchy for readability.</li>
      <li>Use whitespace and grouping to reduce clutter and make information digestible.</li>
      <li>Add icons or visual cues to help users quickly identify sections or categories.</li>
      <li>Modernize the layout using cards or grid sections to organize content.</li>
      <li>Make the design responsive for mobile devices with touch-friendly elements.</li>
